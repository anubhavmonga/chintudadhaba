      <div className="about-text">
        We are a group of professional chefs who had hobby to make food for our
        loved ones by practicing we got better and now due to lack of other
        skills here we are serving to those who we really dont care a single bit
        about thats why we use MSG not NaCl in our food but we are here to do
        business you probably like our food thats why you are back here and to
        be honest we only made food with love for our loved ones and you are
        just another customer so don't think we will treat you like our own and
        do better for you, if you couldn't afford our food we won't even let you
        enter our place and we see nothing wrong in it, you are getting food and
        we are getting money we dont need a relationship over that so just relax
        and don't be bothered if you got any complaints just stop coming over
        again, hope this information was as appetizing as our food if i was you
        i would probably start questioning my life as i just spent 5 minutes in
        reading most worthless thing ever go do something for your own sake.
